# Readme

This Jenkinsfile defines five stages: checkout, code quality, build docker image, Test Docker Image and push docker image. It also defines a custom slackSend function that sends a message to a Slack channel with the provided color and message.

In the code quality stage, the pipeline runs a code quality analysis with SonarQube. In the build docker image stage, the pipeline builds a Docker image tagged with the build number and sends a Slack alert depending on whether the build succeeded or failed. In the Test Docker Image stage, the pipeline will run some test cases and gives the result of the test suits. In the push docker image stage, the pipeline logs in to Docker Hub, tags the Docker image with the build number and pushes it to Docker Hub. Again, it sends a Slack alert depending on whether the push succeeded or failed.

The post section always runs, regardless of the pipeline outcome, and deletes the workspace directory.

Note that you'll need to replace the placeholders with the actual values for your repository, Docker Hub account, Slack channel, and SonarQube configuration. You'll also need to configure the SonarQube and Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins.
